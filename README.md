## Description

KNatCon2020 is a child theme that is built on top of TwentyTwenty and so 
utilizes all the latest features of the block editor and customizer that 
TwentyTwenty uses. It was built specifically for the KOTESOL National Conference 
2020 (https://live.kotesolconf.com). It includes a custom PHP template for 
Jetpack Portfolios and Featured Images on those pages, as well as a custom 404 
page. The Jetpack Portfolio post template was designed to match the styling of 
the presenter pages located on the KOTESOL National Conference 2020 promotional 
website (https://kotesolconf.com).
